 - üïí 45 **hours** for all learning activities
 - üìï **101 topics** with theory and practice adapted to your level
 - üìö **11 projects** to choose from for your portfolio

## You Will Learn
 - Learning the syntax of Java
 - Dealing with integers
 - Working with strings and arrays
 - Getting acquainted with loops and conditions
 - Exploring the basic ideas of object-oriented programming
 - Processing the user's input
 - Handling runtime errors
 - Developing your very first complex program from scratch

## Projects
They are subdivided into 4 difficulties: **Easy**, **Medium**, **Hard** and **Challenging**.

### [Easy](./Easy)
In easy mode we can find:

 1. [**Zookeeper:**](./Easy/ZooKeeper)<br>
This project is aimed at our beginners. It helps you understand some syntax basics and learn how to work with variables, data storage types such as arrays, and while loops.

 2. [**Simple Chatty Bot:**](./Easy/SimpleChattyBot) <br>
Get to know the basic syntax of Java and write a simple program using variables, conditions, loops, and methods.

### [Medium](./Medium)
In medium mode we can find:

 1. [**Cinema Room Manager:**](./Medium/Cinema) <br>
 This project is a good opportunity to work with input and output in Java. You will deal with arrays and functions as well as loops and conditional statements.
 2. [**Simple Tic-Tac-Toe:**](./Medium/TicTacToe) <br>
After finishing this project, you'll get to know a lot about planning and developing a complex program from scratch, using methods, nested lists, list comprehension, handling errors, and processing user input.

### [Hard](./Hard)
In hard mode we can find:

 1. [**BullsAndCows:**](./Hard/BullsAndCows)<br> Learn how to use integer arithmetic, generate random numbers, store data in data structures, and handle errors. 
 2. [**Chuck Norris Cipher Encoder:**](./Hard/ChuckNorrisCipherEncoder)<br> This project will allow us to deal with string and character variables and work with loops and conditional statements. Get familiar with the binary notation and data type conversion. Create an application for the unary representation and decoding of any text.
 3. [**Amazing Numbers:**](./Hard/AmazingNumbers)<br> The project covers basic operations on integers, as well as with collections. Make a program that indicates the properties of the numbers taken from the input.
 4. [**Rock-Paper-Scissors:**](./Hard/Rock-Paper-Scissors)<br> A playable Rock-Paper-Scissors game, with a Player vs. Computer mode. Practice using arrays, the `Random` class, formatted strings, and algorithms. 
 5. [**Coffee Machine:**](./Hard/CoffeeMachine)<br> This project allows you to better understand the basic OOP, its main concepts such as classes, class methods and attributes, and get a taste of Java. Practice working with methods, challenge yourself with loops and conditions, and get more confident with OOP.

### [**Challenging**](./Challenging)<br>
In Challenging mode we can find:
 1. [**Readability Score**](./Challenging/ReadabilityScore)<br> Learn to call programs from the command-line and get more experience with using regexes and Math class.
 2. [**Battleship**](./Challenging/Battleship)<br> You will understand the process of developing such a complex program as a game and learn about processing user input and handling errors.
