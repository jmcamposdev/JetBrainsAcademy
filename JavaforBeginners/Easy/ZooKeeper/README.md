This project is aimed at our beginners. It helps you understand some syntax basics and learn how to work with variables, data storage types such as arrays, and while loops.

This Project is separate in **4 Stages** we will describe each stage.

## Stage 1 ✅
There are many animals in the zoo, and all of them need care. The animals must be fed, cleaned, surrounded by their kin, and kept happy. That is a difficult task for our large zoo, so one of your employers has suggested a more convenient way to keep track of everything. She wants to be able to pull up a video feed of any animal in the zoo with the help of a program. Being able to check on each habitat would help the zookeepers take care of our furry friends more efficiently!

In this project, you will create a program that helps the zookeepers check on the animals and make sure that they're doing well. Your product will be able to process commands from the zookeepers and display the animals on a monitor.

### Objectives 🎯
To begin with, you will develop a simple printer. Your program should display the text from the output example.

Example:
```
I love animals!
Let's check on the animals...
The deer looks fine.
The bat looks happy.
The lion looks healthy.
```

### Solution 💡
For this first Stage the solution is to use `System.out.println()` for each line in the example.

## Stage 2 ✅
One of the most important parts of working with animals is keeping an eye on them. We need to see the animals on the screen to know how they are doing, right? Now we are ready to print something awesome: an image of an animal!

### Objectives 🎯
For the second stage, you will need to develop an animal printer. Your program should display the animal identified in the code field

our output should contain the following ASCII image:

     |      '.-'                  '-.
     |                               ',
     |                                '',
      ',,-,                           ':;
           ',,| ;,,                 ,' ;;
              ! ; !'',,,',',,,,'!  ;   ;:
             : ;  ! !       ! ! ;  ;   :;
             ; ;   ! !      ! !  ; ;   ;,
            ; ;    ! !     ! !   ; ;
            ; ;    ! !    ! !     ; ;
           ;,,      !,!   !,!     ;,;
           /_I      L_I   L_I     /_I
Look at that! Our little camel is sunbathing!
```

### Solution 💡
In this Stage I use a variable to storage the Camen and print it.

## Stage 3 ✅
The third stage requires you to increase the capabilities of your software. Now it should be able to recognize the number of a specific habitat from the input and show the animals living there.

Add all of the variables from the template to a single variable with the list type. The order of variables matters: they must appear on the list in the order in which they're defined in the code. The list must contain all of the variables with no duplicates.

### Objectives 🎯
In this stage your program should:

1.  Ask for the number of the desired habitat using the following phrase:  `Please enter the number of the habitat you would like to view:`
    
2.  Use the input number as an index of your habitats to print its content.
    
3.  End with the following phrase:
    

```no-highlight
---
You've reached the end of the program. To check another habitat, please restart the watcher.
```

The animals order is : Camel, Lion, Deer, Goose, Bat, Rabbit.

### Solution 💡
For this Stage I save all `String` in an `Array` and I ask the user to insert a number between 0 and 6. And finally I print the animal.

## Stage 5 ✅
Now it's time to make our project user-friendly. In this final stage, you'll make your software ready for the zoo staff to use. Your program should understand the habitat numbers, show the animals, and be able to work continuously without having to be restarted.

### Objectives 🎯
Your tasks at this point:
1.  Your program should repeat the behavior from the previous stage, but now in a loop.
2.  Do not forget to include an exit opportunity: inputting  `exit`  should end the program.
3.  When the program is done running, it should print:  `See you later!`
 
### Solution 💡
For this Stage I create a `While` before the `While` I ask the user to insert a number or `"exit"` if the user inserts `"exit"` the program exits or if the user inserts a number I print the corresponding animal and I ask again.

With this the program works but I have added more complex user validations using regular expressions and the Regular Expression is:
`"[0-5]|(exit)"`
This Regular Expression validates if the input is a number between 0 and 5 or if is "exit".  If it doesn't match the program ask again the program ask again
